<h1 class=freestyletutorialiframes>Terms and References</h1>

<h2 class=headersfreestyletutorial>Backstroke</h2>
<p class=howtofreestylepara>"Swimming stroke performed on the back in which the swimmer alternates raising each arm over 
the head and uses an up-and-down flutter kick. The backstroke is a competition stroke, but it is also used in recreational 
swimming as a rest from other strokes, frequently with minimal arm motion and only enough kick to maintain forward motion. 
It is the third fastest of the four main strokes and is likened to an upside-down freestyle."(Backstroke | Swimming | Britannica, n.d.)</p>

<h2 class=headersfreestyletutorial>Breaststroke</h2>
<p class=howtofreestylepara>"Swimming stroke performed lying face down in the water in which swimmers use a wide sweeping 
arm movement and a frog kick to propel themselves forward. The breaststroke is believed to be the oldest stroke and is 
commonly used in lifesaving and recreational swimming as well as in competitive swimming. The stroke is especially 
effective in rough water. It is the slowest of the four swimming strokes."(Breaststroke | Swimming | Britannica, n.d.)</p>

<h2 class=headersfreestyletutorial>Butterfly</h2>
<p class=howtofreestylepara>"Swimming stroke in which the arms are brought forward above the water and the legs kick in 
unison in an up-and-down (dolphin) motion. The butterfly is used mainly in competition, having evolved from the 
breaststroke in the mid-20th century. It is the second fastest stroke, after the freestyle, and is often considered to be 
the most difficult one to master."(“Butterfly | Swimming, Technique, Stroke, Breathing, & Facts | Britannica,” 2024)</p>

<h2 class=headersfreestyletutorial>Freestyle</h2>
<p class=howtofreestylepara>"Freestyle is a category of swimming competition, defined by the rules of World Aquatics, 
in which competitors are subject to only a few limited restrictions on their swimming stroke. Freestyle races are the 
most common of all swimming competitions, with distances beginning with 50 meters (55 yards) and reaching 1,500 meters 
(1,600 yards), also known as the mile. The term 'freestyle stroke' is sometimes used as a synonym for 'front crawl',
 as front crawl is the fastest surface swimming stroke."(Freestyle Swimming, 2021)</p>

<h2 class=headersfreestyletutorial>Front Crawl</h2>
<p class=howtofreestylepara>"The front crawl, aka the freestyle, perhaps the most popular swimming stroke, used in both competitive and recreational 
swimming. It is performed by using an alternating overarm motion combined with a flutter kick. The freestyle has become 
the fastest of all strokes in the pool and is also the almost unanimous stroke of choice for distance swimming."(“Freestyle | Swimming, Technique, Stroke, Breathing, & Facts | Britannica,” 2024)</p>

<h2 class=headersfreestyletutorial>Katie Ledecky</h2>
<p class=howtofreestylepara>"Kathleen Genevieve Ledecky (/ləˈdɛki/ lə-DEK-ee; born March 17, 1997) is an American 
competitive swimmer. She has won nine Olympic gold medals and 21 world championship gold medals, the most in history for 
a female swimmer. With 14 medals and 9 gold medals, she is also the most decorated American woman, most decorated female 
swimmer, the woman with the most gold medals (tied with Larisa Latynina) and fifth-most decorated athlete in Olympic 
history."(Wikipedia Contributors, 2019)</p>

<h2 class=headersfreestyletutorial>Michael Phelps</h2>
<p class=howtofreestylepara>"Michael Fred Phelps II OLY (born June 30, 1985) is an American former competitive 
swimmer. He is the most successful and most decorated Olympian of all time with a total of 28 medals. Phelps also 
holds the all-time records for Olympic gold medals (23),[9] Olympic gold medals in individual events (13), and Olympic 
medals in individual events (16)."(Michael Phelps, 2018)</p>

<h2 class=headersfreestyletutorial>Sidestroke</h2>
<p class=howtofreestylepara>"Swimming stroke, so named because the swimmer lies on one's side with asymmetric arm and leg 
motion. It is helpful as a lifesaving technique and is often used for long-distance swimming. The sidestroke allows the 
swimmer increased endurance because instead of working both arms and legs simultaneously in the same way, the side stroke 
uses them simultaneously but differently. A swimmer tired of exercising one side can turn over and use the other, the 
change of action helping the limbs to recover."(Sidestroke, 2020)</p>
