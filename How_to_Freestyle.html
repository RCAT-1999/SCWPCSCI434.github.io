<h1 class="headersfreestyletutorial">Background</h1>
<p class="howtofreestylepara">The title of this page is misleading. The actual name for this particular swimming stroke is called the front crawl or forward crawl. It is regarded as the fastest and most efficient of the four well known strokes. It is also commonly referred to by the name "freestyle" even though that is the name of the group of strokes versus just the individual stroke itself. On the surface, this stroke looks like it will be easy. I can speak from experience when I say, if you are not used to the demands of water and able to do multi-tasking well, this stroke can be very difficult. I am a firm believer though, that if you try hard enough you can learn any skill. The point of this page is to give you a picture of all the mechanics involved in the front crawl and try to relate to you that it is a very demanding form of exercise if you are not used to it.<br><br>

The front crawl was first seen in the modern world in 1844 at a swimming competition in London. It was used by indigenous swimmers of the northeastern woodlands. The form was later learned by an english swimmer and widely adopted fifty years later. It has since had modifications made and alternate names such as "American crawl", or "Australian crawl". The video below describes all of the mechanics that are required to perform the stroke correctly.

<h1 class="headersfreestyletutorial">The Technique</h1>
<p class="howtofreestylepara">The front crawl is swum in the horizontal with your body and eyes facing down. Your torso and body will turn side to side with each stroke of the arm, turning towards the side that is currently in the water and about to pull. Your head should remain down and facing the bottom of the pool, turning only to take a breath on the side of the arm recovery. It is best practice to turn your head only the amount that is required to take a small breath and then go back to the neutral position. There are seven main phases of arm movement while front crawling. </p>

<h2 class="headersfreestyletutorial">The Downsweep</h2>
<p class="howtofreestylepara">While doing the downsweep, the forearm moves down while the elbow remains high in the water. Your upper arm will move outward and upward. There should be no force used in this movement.</p>

<h2 class="headersfreestyletutorial">The Catch</h2>
<p class="howtofreestylepara">The catch is one of the most crucial movements to front crawling. While the downsweep is occuring, imagine you are on the ground and there is one of those big yoga balls in front of you. Now picture using one of your arms to curl over the ball on the top left or right. That is the position to make during the catch and downsweep. This video will put it into better perspective. The primary reason for this movement is to maximize the use of your back muscles and avoid overusing and injuring your shoulders.</p>

<h2 class="headersfreestyletutorial">The Insweep</h2>
<p class="howtofreestylepara">The movement that follows the catch is known as the insweep. Your arm moves like a big paddle, moving the most water efficiently depending on the placement of your catch. This phase is also known as the pull.</p>

<h2 class="headersfreestyletutorial">The Upsweep</h2>
<p class="howtofreestylepara">In this phase, the hand and forearm changes direction and moves from below the belly toward your hip. At the same time your body will roll toward that side.</p>

<h2 class="headersfreestyletutorial">The Release</h2>
<p class="howtofreestylepara">The arm will leave the water at the hip, the elbow will be leading followed by the forearm and hand.</p>

<h2 class="headersfreestyletutorial">The Recovery</h2>
<p class="howtofreestylepara">The arm swings forward, your forearm should be relaxed and dangling.</p>

<h2 class="headersfreestyletutorial">The Entry and Extension</h2>
<p class="howtofreestylepara">Once the hand passes the head, it should enter the water eighteen inches in front of the head and reach full extension. Your body should roll back to neutral before rolling back to the opposite side to repeat the process again.</p>

<h1 class="headersfreestyletutorial">Common Mistakes</h1>
<p class="howtofreestylepara">The biggest mistakes that you need to avoid in front crawling are, in my opinion, the <a href="https://www.enjoy-swimming.com/freestyle-stroke-mistakes-overreaching.html">overreaching arm</a>, poor catch form, and not maintaining neutral head position. I have linked an article to overreaching arm problem, please read it! Poor catch form leads to potential injury injuries and loss of efficiency and power during swimming, which can make a break your body or your chances in a competition. When you fail to maintain a neutral head position, it can cause disorientation and loss of efficiency due to the weird angle your head is at.</p>
