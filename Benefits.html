  <h1 class=freestyletutorialiframes>Overview</h1>
  
  <p class=howtofreestylepara>As a kid, I remember watching Michael Phelps compete in the Olympics at London in 2012, 
  I was eleven. I remember being amazed and fascinated by the sport. In 2016 at the age of 14, I watched him again at Rio 
  for the last time, the end of an era for the sport, one of the greatest and most dominant athletes, if not the greatest 
  of all time. It wasn't until two years ago that I realized how complex swimming is and the dedication competitive 
  swimmers have to maintain their level of fitness. Swimming is a well known form of exercise that most of us have been 
  doing since our parents first taught us how to swim, or tried to drown us depending on how you look at it.
Interestingly, according to the Red Cross in a survey conducted in 2014, only 80% of Americans know how to swim. Of those, 
54% don't have the basic skill to prevent injury or death. You can read about these basic skills 
<a href=https://www.local3news.com/nearly-half-of-adults-cant-swim-well-enough-to-save-themselves/article_a5a95609-695c-5955-84e9-1b186d16b035.html>here</a>. 
As children, swimming is just a fun pastime and a chance to enjoy time with friends, as adults you are more than likely 
choosing to swim as a form of exercise versus a pastime, unless you have children. It is arguably the best form of 
exercise due to the fact that it works all of your bodies major muscle groups while being a low impact exercise. </p>

<h2 class=headersfreestyletutorial>Muscle Groups</h2>

<p class=howtofreestylepara>One of the biggest advantages of swimming, as mentioned above, is that it truly works your 
entire body from your head to your toes. I can attest to that. Your arms, shoulders and back take most of the load, but 
your abs, legs, and every other muscle are worked as well. When I first began swimming I remember the next day my abs were so 
sore and while swimming my legs will flake out after a while too. Pushing off the wall so often can ware on your legs as 
well as the constant flutter kicking that is done in many forms. There are several forms that are widely used in swimming, 
each one focuses more on specific muscle groups but they all are still full body workouts that build strength, muscles, 
and endurance. I have had days where I will run, swim, and lift. Swimming is typically the last exercise
and it really puts emphasis on the fact that it is a fully body exercise and uses all the muscles that I use to lift and run.</p>

<h2 class=headersfreestyletutorial>Injuries and Other Conditions</h2>

<p class=howtofreestylepara>Many forms of exercise put extreme stress on your joints and can cause premature wear. Being 
obese, having arthritis, injuries, or any disabilities can make it difficult or painful to participate in many traditional 
forms of exercise. Swimming is a safe alternative that doesn't cause as much stress to your joints or muscles and can help 
reduce your pain. In some cases, swimming can become a form of physical therapy. It can work out the daily wear and tear 
that life can put on your body. For example, imagine you are a doctor that is constantly hunched over an operating table. 
Swimming will straighten out your back and work those muscles causing them to be toned and able to withstand being used in 
the manner described above. </p>

<h2 class=headersfreestyletutorial>Way of Life</h2>

<p class=howtofreestylepara>Swimming can have many benefits. The bulk of these benefits are focused around your muscles 
and endurance. In addition to working your muscles, swimming also burns a huge amount of calories from the active muscle 
movement and in some cases the temperature of the water. This can help you lose weight if that is what you're goal is. 
Additionally, it can help improve your sleep. This can be a good option for older adults due to the fact that running may 
not be an option so this form of cardiovascular exercise is a viable alternative. In my experience the benefit for my 
sleep is because I'm typically exhausted from burning myself out in the pool. Swimming can also boost your mood through a 
sense of accomplishment. Swimming is a complex form of exercise that requires a great deal of multitasking, this form of 
mental exercise can be good for individuals with dementia or other cognitive issues. Lastly, i will touch upon the fact 
that swimming can help manage stress. I can personally attest to this one. Many people who exercise do it for stress 
relief. Swimming is no different, it can be very easy to shed ones stressors when swimming.
