<h2><br><br>Who I Am</h2>
  
<p>As the title of this section states, it is a little bit about who I am. I will not use my given name in this section for the sake of privacy. If you happen upon this page you should know my name.<br>
   I am twenty-two years of age and was born and raised in Kansas, which is where I currently live as well. I joined the national guard when I was seventeen and currently serve in the KSNG and hold the grade of E-5<br>
   I am pursuing this degree to make me more knowledgeable about my job and perhaps open career opportunities. I am a fitness enthusiast. I enjoy most cardio based activities with a focus on running and swimming.<br>
   I originally pursued swimming due to an interest to pursue a career in Air Force Special Warfare <a href="https://www.airforce.com/careers/special-warfare-and-combat-support/special-warfare">(AFSPECWAR)</a>. Within that career 
   field I was mainly interested in becoming a <a href="https://www.airforce.com/careers/special-warfare-and-combat-support/special-warfare/combat-control">CCT</a> or a <a href="https://www.airforce.com/careers/special-warfare-and-combat-support/special-warfare/pararescue">PJ</a>. 
   I have since opted not to pursue that career field.<br>
   If you would like to know why, please feel free to reach out. Back to swimming. In the beginning I found it to be extremely challenging both physically but mainly mentally. My water confidence was found to be lacking, badly.<br>
   I have been working at it for a little over a year now and can swim 1500+ meters without stopping. It has vastly improved my cardiovascular endurance as a side effect. I recently completed a half marathon in 1:38:24. At the end I wasn't really winded<br>
   but my muscles were fatigued badly. I have spoken a great deal on cardio based excercise. I also enjoy weight lifting and mainly body weight exercises. I do a lot of push-ups and pull-ups. I don't want to get super swoll like modern fitness influencers<br>
   I'd rather be able to move my own body weight around really well and be more of a gymnast type athlete.<br><br>

   I have spoken a great deal on fitness, but it is my favorite hobby to be sure. I also enjoy playing video games, though I don't play as much as I did in my younger years. Occasionally it is a fun pastime, when I have the time. I have picked up the practice<br>
   of minimalism. I find it easier to keep an inventory of my belongings and it is just enjoyable to me. I also listen to audio books when I drive or when I am doing a task that doesn't really require a lot of mental effort. I am a fan of the Scfi-fantasy genre.<br>
   My favorite authors are probably <a href="https://riyria.blogspot.com/">Michael J. Sullivan</a>, <a href="https://monsterhunternation.com/">Larry Correia</a>, and <a href="https://www.jim-butcher.com/">Jim Butcher</a> to name a few. Lastly, I guess this could be classified as a <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hobby">hobby</a>. I am very particular about the source of the food 
   I eat. I very really eat out, maybe once or twice<br>
   a week. I mainly eat red meat for my diet and I buy it in bulk, half to whole cuts of beef. During the summer I eat vegtables from my families garden and eat grains such as rice, barley, or millet that I buy from the store. Well, that is a little about me.
